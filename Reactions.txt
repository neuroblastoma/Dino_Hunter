Steven Gore:
I learned a great deal from this big project. The biggest one was definitely forward planning. I generally don't forward plan and just code as I go so I can figure out implementation on the way. Seeing how lack of planning can definitely negatively affect you later on down the road has given me a better appreciation for forward planning. Another big thing I learned was group dynamics when it comes to working on code. I've never coded with a group of people before and it was a learning experience. John was able to show me how git worked and I thought that was an awesome resource. As we all modified the code and changed around certain framework, I found myself getting better at interpreting other people's code and understanding what they were coding, and then work my implementation into the new code.
